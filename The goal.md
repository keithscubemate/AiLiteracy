This document will establish material answering the question, "What is AI and when should it be used?" 
This will follow the following structure:

1. [[What is AI]] ->  Contrast symbolic AI, statistical ML, deep learning, and LLMs.

2. [[How do todays AI systems actually work]] ->  Vectors, embeddings, transformers, RAG.

3. [[When not to use AI]] ->  Regex example, rule-based systems.

4. [[The messy middle]] -> Hybrid approaches, cost/benefit thinking.

5. [[What AI can and cannot do]] -> Pattern recognition, language fluency != reasoning, creativity, or true understanding.
