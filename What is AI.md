# Overview 

This page will cover:

- Symbolic AI (rules, expert systems)
- Statistical ML (regression, clustering, trees, SVMs, boosting)
- Neural networks (perceptrons, CNNs, RNNs)
- Genetic / evolutionary algorithms
- Exercises:
	+ Train a simple decision tree on a CSV (e.g., iris dataset).
	+ Implement a tiny neural net from scratch (e.g., XOR problem).

## Genetic / evolutionary algorithms

Genetic algs work by taking Darwinian principles and applying them to pieces of an algorithm:
- Heredity:
- Variation:
- Selection:
